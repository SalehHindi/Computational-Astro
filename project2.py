#Todo:
#*Make it so the size of the room can be changed easily using a roomSize variable
#*Figure out how Desika wants the exponential variable to act
#*Make number of time steps its own variable so it can be changed easier
#*Make my own random number generator, this might improve speed
#*Make my own exponential variable function
